Their sound oscillates between intricate blues-driven solos, creating a sense of ancient and emotive storytelling, and rhythmic explorations of unfamiliar yet alluring states of mind. Listening to Mystical Communication Service represents an enchanted excursion into a nomadic world, where the concepts of sanity and self-awareness fade away. The band creates an ethereal soundscape, leaving you adrift in a haze of desire and dream-like apparitions.",
