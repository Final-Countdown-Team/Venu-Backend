Their sound oscillates between intricate blues-driven solos, creating a sense of ancient and emotive storytelling, and rhythmic explorations of unfamiliar yet alluring states of mind. Listening to Mystical Communication Service represents an enchanted excursion into a nomadic world, where the concepts of sanity and self-awareness fade away.

And yet, Dog Dimension always have a surprise in store, like their recent collaboration with “The Sticky People” (2021), where they extended their classic setup with cello, horn and piano. A debut LP is to be expected in 2023.",
