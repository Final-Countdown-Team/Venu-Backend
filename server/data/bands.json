The band is an amalgamation of wayward drifters and modern-day mystics, uniting to play their distinctive style of psychedelic and experimental rock. Their sound oscillates between intricate blues-driven solos, creating a sense of ancient and emotive storytelling, and rhythmic explorations of unfamiliar yet alluring states of mind. Listening to Mystical Communication Service represents an enchanted excursion into a nomadic world, where the concepts of sanity and self-awareness fade away. The band creates an ethereal soundscape, leaving you adrift in a haze of desire and dream-like apparitions.",

In the 1970s, after their divorce, she released six albums of original songs and an acclaimed live album. Previn's lyrics from this period are characterized by their originality, irony and honesty in dealing with her troubled personal life as well as more generally about relationships, sexuality, religion and psychology. Until her death, she continued to work as a writer of song lyrics and prose.",

    "description": "Berlin-based power trio Dog Dimension have been blasting away at a mix of experimental rock, alt-metal and grunge on their classic bass-guitar-drums setup since 2019. The band has released three EPs so far, that each have their own distinct way of getting to the bottom of musical extremes: While “Area of Outstanding Beauty” (2019) and “Endless Summer” (2021) prioritized an experimental approach, “Rabies” (2022) is a bold affirmation of harder, groovier guitar rock, that’s soaked in the band’s wry aesthetic. And yet, Dog Dimension always have a surprise in store, like their recent collaboration with “The Sticky People” (2021), where they extended their classic setup with cello, horn and piano. A debut LP is to be expected in 2023.",
